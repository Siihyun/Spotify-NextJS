## Description
A clone web application using the next-tailwind template. The app comsumes data from the Spotify API and tries to clone the UI and front-end behaviors of the official [Spotify web player](https://open.spotify.com/) as much as possible.

Unfortunately you can't play music in my deploy version because I don't have spotify PRO account. Instead, I took a list of albums from a specific artist and mimic Spotify music player as if they were playing.

## Motivation
This project was created by me mainly to teach myself Nextjs development. Since the point of this project was not to make great UI/UX design choices, I chose to create a clone of a well established product as to shorten my learning time and not to focus on the wrong thing. 

## Tech/Framework Used
* React
